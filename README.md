## Getting Started

Welcome to Low Level Design for classical systems.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
- `src/{System}`: the folder to every system.

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default (which is excluded for versioning).

## Disclaimer

- These solution may not be the ideal.
- This is just for learning and LLD interview purpose.
